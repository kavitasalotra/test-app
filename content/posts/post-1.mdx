Simply understood, brand architecture is the art and science of structuring the portfolio
to meet your strategic goals, defining the brand number, scope, and relationships
needed to compete. Just as Modern Architecture prioritized function, a Brand Architecture
is only as good as it is well-suited for the purpose it strives to achieve. Given
the disruption observed today across industries and segments, it’s no wonder that
companies are considering structural rather than topical solutions to the challenges
they face.

**Yet the context in which brand architecture decisions are being made has changed.
Gone are the days of “competitive strategy”, with the military-inspired view of competition
as a zero-sum game, where market share needs to be stolen from competitors, often
in a street-by-street battle to win over each individual segment. The type of brand
architecture required to win in this game demanded a dogged focus on each segment,
and a sniper-like collection of individual brands sharply focused on each one. While
there was always a place for a variety of architectures — see Joachimsthaler’s brand
relationship spectrum — houses of brands were favored, as it enabled segment-by-segment
competition and risk protection.**

#### **There are 3 key imperatives to build this type of brand architecture — to be clear, meaningful and stretchable.**

**Clear**: Just as modern architecture thrives on clear and clean lines, so does
brand architecture. In the age of micro-segmentation, micro-targeting, information
overload and digital fragmentation, you need a clear and loud voice in order to stand
out. In the context of short attention spans where specific moments and needstates
need to be targeted in addition to consumer/customer profiles, multiple brands often
lead to confusion. The technology space understood this early, where clear and simple
architectures that bring together simple design, as Apple, with complex technology,
as SAP — always under the discipline of a rigorously simple way to organize.

**Meaningful**:Just as modern architecture prioritizes function over embellishments,
a solid brand architecture is founded on brands and values meaningful to consumers
(or customers), rather than product feature distinctions. Brand architecture needs
to be re-organized around brands that have a “reason for being” compelling enough
to elicit passion, and introducing a clear distinction between brands that merit
air time with consumers vs. “clutter”. The “decluttering” trend is gaining traction
in brand architecture — just as in the popular consumer “decluttering” technique,
only brands that “bring joy” to consumers get the spotlight. TED, for example, leverages
the powerful TED master brand, positioned around “ideas worth spreading”, in a set
of sub-brands that target meaningful occasions and contexts for intellectual exploration
(TED Talks, TEDx, TED-Ed, TED Prize, TED Fellows, TED Institute, TED Radio Hour).

**Stretchable**:Modern architecture is dynamic — it finds its force in the midst
of usage; movement is often embedded into its very bones. In today’s fast-changing
world, brand architecture is a moving target — clients increasingly ask to design
architectures that fit their growth ambitions, thinking through future growth scenarios
and architecting space for the future product pipeline. In particular in industries
undergoing disruption, where next generation products aim to upset the status quo,
their addition to any brand architecture may require a fundamental rethink.
